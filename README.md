# Food Insecurity in the US
Capstone Project on Food Insecurity in USA, 2019

High level description of project: 
One of the hardest things to do in life is to ask for help. Too many families in the United States are struggling with food insecurity. This Current Population Survey asked US households numerous questions that may or may not be related to food insecurity, as well as directly if they were facing insecurity. I will use a model to predict insecurity based on responses to the other questions. If I can make a model that is accurate, I may be able to expand the model to predict which households are in-fact struggling with insecurity but are not able to or are unwilling to admit that they do need some help. With these results, we could try to reach out to these struggling families in a different way to ensure they still receive the help that they need.
